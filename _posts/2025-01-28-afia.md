In the context of the French AI Action summit, various speakers invited by the AfIA shared their feedback on projects involving AI. 
The presentations covered a range of categories, from theoretical discussions to practical applications. The DataLab Group presented the results of its ongoing research on the safety of generative AI solutions and its applications to industrial products.

Generative AI is becoming a staple technology in multiple industries, yet it still poses various challenges, especially regarding safety and security. For these reasons, the DataLab Group has developed expertise in the security of large language models (LLMs).

Our focus was mainly on manual red teaming by internal teams. This approach helps us better understand the risks and design more effective defenses. We also provided insights into the current work we are conducting.

We engaged with various speakers on the potential and risks of AI in the near future.
