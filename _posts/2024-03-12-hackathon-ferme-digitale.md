**In the context of the International Agricultural Show 2024 in Paris, the DataLab Groupe participated in the digital farm hackathon, where the goal was to use AI to build a tool aimed at helping farmers.*


GAIA (Generative Artificial Intelligence for Agriculture) was launched during SIA’PRO, a new three-day event, from February 25 to 27, 2024, aimed at farmers and agricultural industry professionals involved in animal and plant sectors.
Participants worked for 48 hours to present a concrete solution to a farmer's problem using the Artificial Intelligence proposed by the French company Mistral AI.
The eight competing teams selected use cases from those expressed by farmers. Auchan, Avril, Groupama and ACTA were among those participating in the hackathon.
At the end of the two days of work, they were able to present the solutions they developed and the results obtained.

Assisting in the search through regulatory corpora;
As a bonus, another case to help farmers fill out numerous and lengthy forms from these regulatory texts.
In practice, the solution is a conversational assistant to which the farmer asks a question, for example: "I am a cattle farmer with a herd of 105 suckler cows. What should be the minimum capacity of my effluent storage?" or in terms of aid "I am a cattle farmer, I have a herd of 33 cows and 300 bulls, what is the amount of the PMTVA?".
The assistant then provides the answer or explains what information is missing, demonstrating the usefulness of artificial intelligence to farmers and agriculture.
