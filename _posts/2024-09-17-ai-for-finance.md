The DataLab Groupe took part in the 6th edition of AI For Finance, on the theme "Generative AI", which was held on September 17 at the Palais Brongniart in Paris. During this event, Aldrick Zappellini, Group Data Director & CDO Group, spoke on the main stage to discuss the integration of AI into the group's strategy. Key takeaways from this intervention:

- AI at Cr√©dit Agricole frees up time for employees to better serve clients with empathy and discernment, while being a responsible driver to accompany societal transitions (climate, energy, health, etc).
- Our strategy remains unchanged in the face of the emergence of GenAI, favoring a controlled adoption while training our teams, protecting data, experimenting cautiously, managing risks, and choosing technologies based on value and compliance.

Furthermore, a masterclass (also available on Youtube : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBYeiIEnueo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBYeiIEnueo)) was led by Aldrick Zappellini along with Aymen Shabou (CTO DataLab Groupe and AI Factory Group) and Samuel Laloum (AI & Data Project Manager), focusing on **CA Generative Search**, an industrial platform developed by the DataLab Groupe, enabling searches in large documentary corpora thanks to LLM and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
