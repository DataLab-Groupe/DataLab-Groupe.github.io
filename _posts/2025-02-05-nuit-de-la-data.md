**The Crédit Agricole Group DataLab recently received notable recognition at the prestigious "Nuit de la Data & de l'IA" (Data & AI Night) organized by REPUBLIK DATA & IA. ClimAtlas won both the silver medal and the special jury prize in the "Data & IA for Green" category - a double distinction highlighting the impact and innovation of this forward-looking project.**

**About ClimAtlas: Making Climate Change Visible**
ClimAtlas transforms complex climate data into accessible information through an interactive mapping system that visualizes climate change impacts at local levels. The tool allows users to see concrete climate projections according to different IPCC scenarios, from community to national scale.

**The Tool's Approach**
ClimAtlas was developed in three phases:

•	Implementation of weather indicators
•	Integration of agricultural indicators
•	Deployment of physical risk assessment
This provides a comprehensive view of climate challenges with community-level weather forecasts, projections of impacts on French agriculture, and evaluation of physical risks like clay soil expansion.

**Impact and Future Development**
Beyond raising awareness, ClimAtlas serves as an action and awareness tool for strategic planning and helping employees to support clients adapt to climate risks. Its impact extends beyond Crédit Agricole, with startup KHome now using the data for real estate risk management throughout France.

Future developments will include adding new indicators such as water stress, flood and submersion risks, and coastal erosion.

**The Importance of the Award**
The double recognition at the Nuit de la Data & de l'IA confirms the relevance of this approach and Crédit Agricole's commitment to sustainable and responsible finance aligned with today's environmental challenges. The project builds on public open data initiatives, demonstrating the importance of data sharing in collectively addressing climate challenges.
