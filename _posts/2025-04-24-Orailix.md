[ORAILIX](https://orailix.com/) is a newly established AI research team at the [Laboratoire Informatique (LIX)](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/) of École Polytechnique. Founded in September 2024, it aims to develop new hybrid approaches that combine the power of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and architectures with the robustness of Operational Research (OR) methods.

The team is directed by Sonia Vanier, who is also the lead of the research chair [“Responsible and Trustworthy AI”](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/chaire_xcredit_agricole/) between École Polytechnique and Crédit Agricole. Supported by Crédit Agricole's DataLab Groupe, this research chair aims to contribute to the development of systems based on trusted, ethical, robust, secure and sustainable artificial intelligence. The projects of the chair aim to improve the reliability of AI systems, through hybrid approaches between several disciplines and involving different research communities: symbolic AI, operations research, connectionist AI and machine learning. 

The creation of the ORAILIX team is an excellent opportunity to encourage interdisciplinary exchanges with researchers working in a wide variety of fields, including optimization, reinforcement, learning and industrial modeling. ORAILIX also holds the [“AI and optimization for mobility”](https://www.polytechnique.edu/fondation/actualites/toutes-les-actualites/le-groupe-sncf-lx-et-la-fx-creent-la-chaire-ia-et-optimisation-pour-les-mobilites) research chair with the SNCF Group, as well as industrial partnerships with Systemix, Renault and Orange.
