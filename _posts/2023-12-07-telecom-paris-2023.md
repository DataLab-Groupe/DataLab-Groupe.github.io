On Thursday 16th, November, Achraf SAGHE, Emeric TONNELIER and Paul WASSERMANN, data scientists at the DataLab Groupe, had the chance to meet with students of the top engineering school Télécom Paris.

Datalab Groupe is excited to welcome eight interns who will be working on diverse subjects, including Large Language Models (LLM), GPU-optimized algorithms, and climate risks. If you are interested in exploring these internship opportunities, you can find more details and apply through the following link: [Internships for 2024 in DataLab Groupe](https://datalab-groupe.github.io/2023-09-20-internships-2024/). As part of our efforts to find talented interns, we recently held virtual meetings with students from Télécom Paris, during which we presented our internship offerings and discussed potential collaborations.
