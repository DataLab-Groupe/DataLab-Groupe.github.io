The DataLab Groupe delivered a presentation on **generative AI**, focusing on its potential **risks**, **detection methods**, and **prevention strategies**. Given the growing interest in applying generative AI within industrial contexts, the DataLab Group has embarked on experiments to explore how this technology can be effectively utilized in such environments.

We were delighted to share our progress on this critical subject. With numerous discussions on generative AI taking place, we believe that addressing its risks and detection methodologies is a valuable contribution.

Furthermore, we were thrilled to conduct workshops on various aspects of generative AI. Attendees of our presentation were eager to engage with us further on this topic, highlighting the widespread interest in experimenting with generative AI. However, it became apparent that its industrial application is often overlooked.

Having previously collaborated with IMA at events like Imagine Day, we look forward to continuing our partnership, aiming to inspire attendees through future events.
