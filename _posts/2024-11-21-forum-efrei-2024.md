On Thursday, November 14, 2024, Raphael UZAN and Ghassen BETTAIEB, two data scientists from the Datalab Group, participated in a meeting with students from EFREI, a general digital engineering school belonging to the University of Paris-Panthéon-Assas as a component establishment.. 

During this forum, the data scientists had the opportunity to present seven internship topics proposed by the Datalab Group for the year 2025. These topics are focused on cutting-edge themes such as automatic response generation systems (RAG), personalized recommendation engines, and climate risk analysis. The various internship topics are available at the following link: [internships](/2024-10-20-internships-2025/)

This meeting was a chance for students to discover the challenges and opportunities presented by the field of data science, while establishing valuable connections with professionals in the sector.
