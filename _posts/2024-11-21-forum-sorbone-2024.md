On Thursday, November 14, 2024, Thomas CAPDEVIELLE, Paul WASSERMANN and Emeric TONNELIER, three data scientists from the Datalab Group, participated in a speed dating event with students at the Sorbonne University, an initiative organized by the Sorbonne Center for Artificial Intelligence (SCAI) in partnership with Datacraft and the Doctoral College of Sorbonne University. 

During this forum, the data scientists had the opportunity to present seven internship topics proposed by the Datalab Group for the year 2025 . These topics are focused on cutting-edge themes such as automatic response generation systems (RAG), personalized recommendation engines, and climate risk analysis. The various internship topics are available at the following link: [internships](/2024-10-20-internships-2025/)

This meeting was a chance for students to discover the challenges and opportunities presented by the field of data science, while establishing valuable connections with professionals in the sector.
