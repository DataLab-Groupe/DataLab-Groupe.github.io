Held each October, PMA Days is Crédit Agricole’s annual internal marketing conference, designed to bring together teams from both Crédit Agricole’s regional Banks and Business departments. On October 15-16, the 2024 conference took place at Cent-Quatre, gathering 2,500 participants from diverse sectors for two days of engaging demos, panel discussions, and collaborative workshops. Here are the key takeaways of the Datalab Groupe’s presentations : 
* **CA Generative Search**: Demonstrated applications across specific business sectors, showcasing tailored AI search solutions (RAG etc.).
* **Sécuri’Chat**: Introduced as a daily-use, secure chat platform accessible to all employees, enhancing internal communication.
* **Data/AI Tools for CRM Marketing**: Highlighted the multiproduct scoring model, validated through AB testing, to boost marketing precision.
* **AI-Generated Email Response Suggestions**: Presented a demo of generative AI for customer support automation.
* **Clim Atlas & OpenDataMart**: Showcased environmental monitoring tools, including Clim Atlas and OpenDataMart, focusing on energy and electric station data analysis.
Other participants included partner entities, FNCA, regional banks, CA-TS, Crédit Agricole S.A., and diverse Group sectors, always in the search to align on the 2025 annual marketing plan, structured around two main goals: enhancing attractiveness and fostering innovation for digital performance, aligned with the regional banks' 2030 ambitions.
